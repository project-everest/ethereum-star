(* Sketching the semantics of a combination of state and exceptions,
   as provided in ethereum, and described to me by Antoine
   Delignat-Lavaud *)
   
module EtherST

(* The basic idea is to define a combination of an exception and state monad, 
   with an additional bit of boolean state to record when a send may have failed.

   If this were using the Dm4Free construction, we would have written the monad as:

   EST (a:Type) = h0:heap                 //the input state
		-> send_failed:bool       //an input flag, recording whether or not a send has failed so far
		-> Tot (option (a * heap) //the output state is an optional pair, because throwing an exception discards (and resets) the state
		        * bool)           //the output flag, recording whether this computation has a failed send

   with

   return (a:Type) (x:a) : EST a = 
     fun h0 b0 -> Some (x, h0), b0

   bind (a:Type) (b:Type) (f:EST a) (g:a -> EST b) : EST b = 
     fun h0 b0 ->
	 match f h0 b0 with
	 | None, b1 -> None, b1 //if the first computation throws, the state is gone, but the flag remains
	 | Some (x, h1), b1 -> g x h1 b1  //otherwise, we run the second computation with the new state and flag


  Much of what follows is this basic idea, but it's a bit convoluted
  because of the WP style. We should make this work with Dm4Free so
  that we can really write what's above instead of the verbose stuff
  that follows.

  One wrinkle is that I define everything first generically over the
  type of the state, and then instantiate the state to FStar.Heap.heap.
  That should allow us to plug in whatever memory model you like, later.
